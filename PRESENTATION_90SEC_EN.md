## DELIVERY TECHNIQUE IN JOBS STYLE

### Voice and Pace

- **Opening:** Slowly, quietly, intimately
- **Development:** Acceleration, energy buildup
- **Climax:** Maximum emotion on "transformation"
- **Finale:** Slowdown, return to intimacy

### Pauses

- **Short pauses (1 sec):** Between phrases for absorption
- **Medium pauses (2 sec):** After key moments
- **Long pauses (3+ sec):** Only in finale, for drama

### Emphasis

- **"This is wrong"** - first emotional peak
- **"Memento Mori"** - name as brand, say with weight
- **"This is a transformation"** - climax
- **"And be prepared for it"** - philosophical finale

### Gestures (if live presentation)

- **Hands down** - at start, intimacy
- **Hands up** - on "transformation", openness
- **One hand forward** - on "Memento Mori", pointing direction
- **Hands to heart** - in finale, emotional connection

## FULL TEXT WITHOUT PAUSES (for reference)

"When a loved one passes away, you're left alone with grief. And in this very moment, when you're most vulnerable, you're forced to make decisions. Expensive decisions. Complex decisions. In scattered places. With non-transparent prices. Without support. This is wrong.

We thought: what if everything could be different? Memento Mori. A platform that unites everything. Choice of faith and rituals. All goods and services. Will. Funeral organization. In one place. With transparent prices. With document automation. With the ability to plan in advance. Freeing loved ones from difficult decisions.

This is not just a platform. This is a transformation. What was once chaos becomes order. What was once pain becomes support. What was once non-transparent becomes clarity.

Memento Mori. And be prepared for it. Transformation of a painful process into a transparent, organized, and protected ecosystem. Where a person plans important matters in advance. And loved ones receive support and clarity. Thank you."

**Remember:** In Jobs style, it's not what you say, but how you say it. Emotion, pauses, simplicity - that's the secret.

_"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."_ - Steve Jobs
