```
I'm the CEO and Founder of Memento Mori, a comprehensive marketplace platform that connects families with verified funeral service providers. Our mission is to transform how people access and organize end-of-life services by providing transparency, security, and convenience.

**What We're Building:**
Memento Mori is solving a critical problem: organizing funeral services during times of grief is overwhelming. Families face difficulty finding reliable providers, lack of price transparency, and risk of fraud. We're addressing these challenges through:

• A trusted marketplace connecting families with verified providers
• Transparent pricing and secure escrow payments
• Free will preparation services
• Comprehensive solution for all funeral needs

**Our Impact:**
We're building a platform that helps families during their most difficult times, providing them with trusted, transparent, and secure access to funeral services. We're also creating opportunities for funeral service providers, lawyers, and notaries to reach new clients and grow their businesses.

I'm always interested in connecting with entrepreneurs, investors, funeral industry professionals, and anyone passionate about improving end-of-life services.
